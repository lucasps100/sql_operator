# sql_operator
A class for simplifying MySQL script with MySQL-Connector, Pandas, and NumPy.


Connect to you your own MySQL root to create databases, create and alter tables, insert data into tables, and query tables without typing a line of SQL script.

Use the 'selection_to_df' method to return complex queries as Pandas dataframes. 
Use the 'enter_df' method to insert a Pandas dataframe directly into your table.

*Full documentation, example code, and more methods soon to come.*
